# A-star-Path-Planning

**Description:**

Implementation of A star Algorithm on a map using OpenCV Python:
Pixels were used as nodes in the algorithm. We have to give the initial and the goal position coordinates to get the shortest path according to A star Algorithm.

**Results:**

Firstly, implemented the Algorithm in a simple scenario with a circle figure in between.
